    <h1>Terms and Conditions 📜</h1>

    <p><b></b><br>
    This space is very important to me. All my artwork, style, and characters have been built with dedication and care, so I ask for respect at all times.
    This includes kind messages, avoiding constant pressure, not demanding changes outside what was agreed upon, and not using offensive language.
    If I ever receive serious disrespect or abusive behavior, I reserve the right to deny or cancel the commission.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>1. Commissions and Scope of Work</b><br>
    When you place an order, it must only include what was agreed in writing: references, description, style, size, and exact details.
    Large changes afterwards (adding characters, changing the background, altering the style, reworking most of the piece) will require an extra fee and may extend the deadline.
    </p>
    


    <p><b>2. Delivery Time</b><br>
    Normal delivery time is between 1 to 2 months.
    The timer begins once I receive the initial payment and all references.
    If something outside my control happens (illness, technical failure, personal emergencies), I will notify you and ask for extra time.
    If more than 2 months pass with no delivery, you have the right to a full refund.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>3. Credits When Using My Character</b><br>
    If you use artwork containing my character, you must give visible credit.
    Example: “Art by Whysper”.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>4. Commercial Rights and Extra Fees</b><br>
    Base commission prices only include personal use.
    If you want to use the art commercially (merch, branding, products, advertising), you must pay for commercial rights.
    If you decide to purchase these rights after the artwork is finished, an additional fee will apply.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>5. Artwork Delivery</b><br>
    After delivery, you may request minor corrections.
    Major changes after delivery will have an additional cost.
    Files will be delivered in the agreed formats (PNG, JPG, etc.).
    </p>

    

    <p><b>6. Payments and Deadlines</b><br>
    Work only starts once the initial payment is made.
    If the artwork is finished and the client still owes payment, they have up to 2 weeks to complete it.
    Failure to pay within that period counts as a violation of these terms.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>7. Refunds</b><br>
    You are entitled to a full refund if the artwork is not delivered after 2 months.
    Partial refunds may be given if I have already started working.
    Refunds may also be offered for clients facing financial issues if discussed early.
    </p>

    

    <p><b>8. Blacklist and Bans</b><br>
    If a client violates any terms, I may add them to my blacklist.
    Being blacklisted means:
    <br>• I will no longer accept commissions from them  
    • They cannot join raffles, events, or special commission slots  
    • They lose access to priority or future work opportunities  
    <br><br>
    Reasons for blacklisting include:
    <br>• Disrespect or abusive behavior  
    • Using my art without credit  
    • Using my art commercially without paying  
    • Failing to pay after delivery  
    • Dishonesty, manipulation, or scams  
    </p>

    

    <p><b>9. Use of My Artwork</b><br>
    I may post finished commissions on my social media or portfolio unless we agree to keep them private.
    </p>


    <p><b>10. Additional charges and references</b><br>
    Extra charges are explained in my other categories; these include "mid-project design changes, adding another character, changing the setting, color, or position." I don't create custom characters, and if you'd like one, you must have a furry character before I accept your commission (this means your commission will be done in my style).
    </p>

    <p><b>11. Acceptance</b><br>
    By placing an order, you agree to all of these terms, 
I may change these terms and conditions without prior notice; it is your right to check them regularly for any modifications.
